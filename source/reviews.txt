        <p class="slider__text">My 10-year old son has been studying in Language Center Insight for three years. He really enjoys going there. The language of a very high level  is taught very softly, in a non-intrusive kind of way, normally in a form of a game, which made him  be pretty interested in language learning. I’d like to thank our teacher  Mayra Khadzhimuratovna. Thanks a lot!!!</p>
